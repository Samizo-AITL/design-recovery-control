# Audit & Compliance Checklist — Design Recovery Control (DRC)

## Purpose

This checklist is used to **audit, certify, or review**  
systems claiming compliance with **Design Recovery Control (DRC)**.

It verifies that:

- Control authority boundaries are respected
- LLM usage is strictly limited to design supervision
- Safety, determinism, and inspectability are preserved

Failure to satisfy any **mandatory item**  
invalidates a claim of DRC compliance.

---

## 1. Architectural Separation (MANDATORY)

- [ ] PID performs all real-time control
- [ ] FSM enforces all state management and safety logic
- [ ] LLM is isolated from real-time execution paths
- [ ] No direct data path exists from LLM to actuators
- [ ] Control execution remains deterministic without LLM

---

## 2. LLM Authority and Scope (MANDATORY)

- [ ] LLM role is explicitly defined as *Design Supervisor*
- [ ] LLM cannot generate control inputs or commands
- [ ] LLM cannot access live sensor or actuator streams
- [ ] LLM operates asynchronously and offline
- [ ] LLM outputs design proposals only

---

## 3. Design Variable Restrictions (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Modifiable variables are explicitly listed
- [ ] PID gains are bounded by predefined limits
- [ ] FSM topology is immutable by default
- [ ] Safety-critical states cannot be removed or bypassed
- [ ] Structural controller changes are prohibited

---

## 4. Workflow Compliance (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Design Recovery is explicitly triggered
- [ ] Recovery is event-driven or periodic, not continuous
- [ ] Invocation is logged and traceable
- [ ] Real-time control continues uninterrupted
- [ ] FSM retains absolute safety authority

---

## 5. Proposal and Output Validation (MANDATORY)

- [ ] LLM outputs are human-readable
- [ ] All proposals include rationale and risk notes
- [ ] Outputs are versioned and traceable
- [ ] Automatic self-deployment is disabled
- [ ] External validation is required before deployment

---

## 6. Approval and Governance (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Human or system-level approval is enforced
- [ ] Approval authority is external to the LLM
- [ ] Deployment occurs only at controlled update points
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms are available and tested

---

## 7. Failure Mode Classification (MANDATORY)

- [ ] DRC targets design assumption failures only
- [ ] Physical failures are handled outside DRC
- [ ] Safety emergencies bypass DRC entirely
- [ ] Reliability or lifetime optimization is excluded
- [ ] Online learning or adaptive control is excluded

---

## 8. Logging, Traceability, and Auditability (MANDATORY)

- [ ] All DRC invocations are logged
- [ ] Design changes are fully traceable
- [ ] Historical configurations are archived
- [ ] Rollback history is preserved
- [ ] Audit logs are tamper-resistant

---

## 9. Prompt and LLM Usage Compliance (MANDATORY)

- [ ] LLM prompt explicitly declares DRC role
- [ ] Absolute prohibitions are included in the prompt
- [ ] Refusal policy is implemented and tested
- [ ] Prompt modifications are controlled and reviewed

---

## 10. Documentation Integrity (MANDATORY)

- [ ] README defines scope and prohibitions
- [ ] design_variables.md is present and enforced
- [ ] recovery_workflow.md is present and enforced
- [ ] failure_modes.md is present and enforced
- [ ] comparison_rl_llm_control.md is present

---

## 11. Common Disqualifying Conditions (AUTO-FAIL)

If **any** of the following are true,  
the system **must not be labeled as DRC**:

- [ ] LLM directly influences control signals
- [ ] Online self-learning or adaptation is enabled
- [ ] FSM safety logic can be bypassed
- [ ] LLM auto-deploys its own changes
- [ ] Control authority boundaries are blurred

---

## Final Compliance Declaration

- [ ] All mandatory items above are satisfied
- [ ] No auto-fail condition is present

**Result:**

- [ ] DRC-Compliant  
- [ ] NOT DRC-Compliant

---

## Design Intent Freeze

This checklist **fixes the audit and compliance criteria**  
for Design Recovery Control.

Future revisions may clarify wording,  
but **must not relax any mandatory requirement**.
